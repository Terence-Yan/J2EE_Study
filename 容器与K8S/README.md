### Docker
Docker Engine is the industry’s de facto container runtime that runs on various Linux 
(CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu) and Windows Server 
operating systems. Docker creates simple tooling and a universal packaging approach that 
bundles up all application dependencies inside a container which is then run on Docker 
Engine. Docker Engine enables containerized applications to run anywhere consistently on 
any infrastructure, solving “dependency hell” for developers and operations teams, and 
eliminating the “it works on my laptop!” problem.

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management
 of containerized applications.
